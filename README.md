# gangluffSoundBoard

This soundboard was developed my during my senior year of high school (2014/2015) for my AP Chemistry teacher Mr. Gangluff. The soundboard plays user (with access to source code) customizeable files and can take in key presses to play sounds. 

##Controls
The board arranges sounds into a 4x10 grid with each sound corresponding to a key.
The first sound in each row corresponds to the first button of each row on a standard QWERTY keyboard (1, Q, A, Z). 
The space bar also serves as the mute button for the board.
